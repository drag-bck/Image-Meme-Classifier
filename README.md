# Image-Meme-Classifier

I am not an active user of social media so I used to face problems in understanding the meaning and the humour behind the meme. I did not wanted for my friends to make fun of me over such petty thing because that would have made me shrink in front of them so I used my knowledge of Machine Learning and AI and created this meme classifier that helped me in identifying the memes as well as it gave me a chance to enjoy these picture jokes. Now I give this power to you, use it wisely. 

Requirement
1. Python 3
2. Tensorflow

How To Use
1. Save the project in any directory of your computer.
2. Choose an image or a meme.
3. Open CMD and go into the directory where you have saved the code of this project.
4. In CMD type : python classify_meme.py <path of the image>. Ex. python classify_meme.py C:\Users\Comp\Desktop\Image.jpg
5. If the magic of maths worked correctly you should see a class to which the meme belongs and how much my math is accurate in predecting the meme.
  
  
  PS: If I am not sure, like less than 50%, in that case you are on your own.
